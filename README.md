## Abstract
We propose a plug-and-play (PnP) method, which uses deep-learning-based denoisersas regularization priors for spectral snapshot compressive imaging (SCI). Our method is efficient in terms of reconstruction quality and speed trade-off, and flexible to be ready-to-use for differentcompressive coding mechanisms.
