## Abstract
We propose a plug-and-play (PnP) method, which uses deep-learning-based denoisersas regularization priors for spectral snapshot compressive imaging (SCI). Our method is efficient in terms of reconstruction quality and speed trade-off, and flexible to be ready-to-use for differentcompressive coding mechanisms.

## Usage
1. Download this repository via git or download the [zip file](https://codeload.github.com/zsm1211/PnP-CASSI/zip/main) manually.
```
git clone https://github.com/zsm1211/PnP-CASSI
```
2. Run the file **main.py** to test the data.

3. We provide masks at 3 different resolutions, you can generate your own mask for HSI at different resolutions.
